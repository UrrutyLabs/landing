    "productFraming": {
      "title": "Product Framing & Prioritization",
      "description": "We worked with the founder to translate the proven business model into a digital product. We clarified what needed to be built for launch, who it served, and what success looked like in the first 90 days. This involved defining core user types and roles (buyer, manufacturer, and superadmin), implementing authentication and authorization systems for sign up and sign in. We prioritized building the product catalog, manufacturer profiling and documentation capabilities, and order pricing calculation systems—the essential features needed for the platform to function as a D2B marketplace from day one."

    "architecture": {
      "title": "Architecture & System Design",
      "description": "Senior engineers designed the platform architecture from the ground up to support D2B transactions and future growth. We chose a web-first approach, selected a relational database architecture to support scale and complex business logic, and designed system boundaries with low coupling—using third-party services only for authentication and data storage, keeping the core business logic independent. This approach ensured the platform could evolve without vendor lock-in while maintaining security and reliability standards required for commercial D2B transactions."

      "title": "Production-Ready MVP Implementation",

      "title": "Development Infrastructure & Quality Assurance",
      "description": "We established the complete development infrastructure: GitHub repository setup, CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment, and comprehensive unit tests throughout the codebase. This ensured code quality, reliable deployments, and a foundation that the founder's team could maintain and extend with confidence."

    "security": {
      "title": "Security, Reliability & Monitoring",
      "description": "We implemented security measures, error handling, and monitoring systems essential for a D2B platform. The founder needed confidence that the platform could handle commercial transactions reliably from launch day."

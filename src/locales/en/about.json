  "philosophy": {
    "h2": "Our philosophy: speed without regret.",
    "p1": "The MVP model made sense when building software was expensive. You validated quickly, learned, then rebuilt. But AI has changed execution economics — we can build faster than ever. What remains scarce is judgment: knowing what to build, how to structure it, and when to make tradeoffs.",
    "p2": "A Foundational Viable Product (FVP) is built for speed without being disposable. It's enabled by AI to accelerate execution, but guided by human judgment to ensure quality, clarity, and optionality. You learn fast, but you also build something worth keeping."
  },
  "intro": {
    "p1": "Urruty Labs helps founders turn validated ideas or unstable MVPs into Foundational Viable Products (FVPs). We work with early-stage startups that have traction but need a solid technical foundation to scale.",
    "p2": "Our 90-day decision window is designed for clarity and momentum. We focus on what you need to launch, not what's nice to have. Every decision is made by senior engineers who've built products that scale. We use AI to accelerate clarity and execution, but human judgment owns every architectural choice and line of production code.",
    "p2Link": "90-day decision window",
    "p3": "When we're done, you get a clean handoff: complete documentation, clear architecture, and a system your team can understand and extend independently. No vendor lock-in, no ongoing dependencies.",

  "whyChooseUs": {
    "h2": "Why Founders Choose Us",
    "p1": "Founders come to us when they need trustworthy technical leadership. They've outgrown their MVP or need to build their first FVP. They want someone who understands both the technical and business sides of building a product.",
    "p2": "They want to avoid rewrites and wasted time. They've seen what happens when technical debt compounds. They want a foundational viable product that scales, not another disposable prototype that needs to be rebuilt in six months.",
    "p3": "They seek fast, thoughtful execution. Speed matters, but so does quality. They want someone who can move quickly without cutting corners that will cost them later.",
    "p4": "They prefer a partner who understands startup realities: speed, uncertainty, resource constraints. Someone who's been there, made the tradeoffs, and knows what actually matters when you're building something new."
